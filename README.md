<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<h2 id="project-description"> :pencil: Project Description </h2>

<p align="justify"> 
My project aims to enhance the customer experience on a beauty services website by integrating a smart FAQ chatbot, utilizing Azure Bot Service and QnA Maker. This website offers a range of beauty services, including hairstyling, makeup, and spa treatments. The core idea is to solve the problem of limited customer support availability and response delays by providing an automated, round-the-clock solution. 

The chatbot is designed to handle common inquiries, offering instant, accurate responses, which significantly reduces the time customers spend waiting for support. This functionality is particularly beneficial for busy individuals who seek quick information about services, pricing, and availability.

By leveraging Azure Bot Service, the chatbot is easily scalable and can handle multiple queries simultaneously without compromising performance. QnA Maker enables the bot to learn and improve its responses over time, ensuring it stays relevant and helpful.

The project is targeted at both potential customers looking for beauty services and the service providers themselves, aiming to streamline customer interactions and improve service delivery. Key features include a user-friendly interface, robust backend integration with Azure services, and an intuitive content management system for updating QnA pairs. This innovation addresses a clear need in the beauty services market for efficient customer support, thus enhancing user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
